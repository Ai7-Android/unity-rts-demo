unity-rts-demo
==============

A demo / foundation for an RTS game built using Unity 3d (4.x) with C# scripting. This is being built up alongside a tutorial being written for it. The tutorial can be found at www.stormtek.geek.nz/rts_tutorial.

NOTE: this is not officially supported for Unity 5. Most of the code should work, but you may need to modify some things in order to get it to compile.
